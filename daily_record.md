## ipTime N3U doesn't work.
I had bought the ipTime N3U, but it doesn't work in ubuntu 14.04, so I tried to install the driver of N3U (Realtek rtl8192eu-linux-driver), it was impossible to install. Because linux kernel of STEP computer (embedded computer) is customed. so, I can't find this kernel. therefore I bought the new tp link wireless USB adapter. it was made before 2014. so I anticipate it will work properly in Step computer.

## iptime N3U가 작동이 안됨.
무선 인터넷이 필요해서 N3U를 구매했는데, step 컴퓨터에서 제대로 인식하지 않음. 그래서 드라이버를 설치하려 했으나 커스텀 kernel이라서 드라이버도 설치할 수 없었음. 그래서 새로운 어댑터를 구매하여 연결함.
